                                    <p>Flugtube is for the adventurer, the trend setter, and those who want to remember their
                                        journeys. The team were unimpressed with the current options available for a trip
                                        that should be life changing and memorable, we saw just 2 options currently serving
                                        the market.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="list_view">
                                        <p><i class="fa  fa-check-circle"></i> Book with a larger corporate travel agent who
                                            will provide you with remade routes that everyone else is also taking. We didn’t
                                            think there was much individuality to this.</p>
                                        <p><i class="fa  fa-check-circle"></i> Spend weeks sitting in-front of the computer

                                            the trip to connect. We didn't think this was a nice way to start a holiday.
                                            So we decided to change the process…</p>

                                            From our own experience we feel that the hostel market is underserved, there are not many options and most of the websites
                                            seem incredibly out dated. Which is strange, from our own experience, hostel
                                            goers are the best type of travellers, so again, we decided to change the process…</p>

                                        <p>At the moment we use the Skyscanner platform to connect you to the vendor to buy
                                            your tickets. We are working on integrating our own flight booking system, but
                                            to give you the best possible price until then, Skyscanner is a great solution.</p>

                                            email confirmation you receive will detail the process to make amendments. Changes
                                            for accommodation bookings are handled by the Hostels, all the details are explained
